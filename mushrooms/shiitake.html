        <h3 class="infoCat">Appearance</h3>
            <p>
                Shiitake mushrooms have warm brown caps, lightly textured surfaces, and pale undersides. They grow in firm, umbrella-shaped clusters and are known for their classic gourmet appearance.
            </p>

        <h3 class="infoCat">Texture and Flavor</h3>
            <p>
                Shiitake have a dense, meaty texture and deep umami flavor. When cooked, they become tender with a rich, savory aroma that works well in broths, stir-fries, and roasted dishes.
            </p>

        <h3 class="infoCat">Culinary Uses</h3>
        <p>
            Shiitake pair well with rice dishes, noodles, soups, and sautéed vegetables. Their stems also contribute strong flavor when dried and used in stocks.
        </p>

        <h3 class="infoCat">Additional Info</h3>
            <p>
                Store dried mushroom in a cool, dry place. Rehydrate mushrooms by soaking in warm water for 1 to 2 hours until soft. Drain and squeeze lightly before cooking.
